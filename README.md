# QPL 
QPL (Quick Production Library)  - Copyright (c) Daniel Rabl (danielrabl1999@gmail.com). 

This is a C++20 personal utility library with many purposes to help developement.
It uses alot of features from the great [SFML library](https://www.sfml-dev.org/) and builds upon that.
Please note that since this a one-man project there can be mistakes in the implementations.
Features like `qpl::aes`, `qpl::huffman_coding` and `qpl::floating_point<mantissa_bits, exponent_bits>`
were implemented for my personal usage. They might have mistakes and might be slow:
I highly recommend installing the feature from a greater source, especially if deployed in a serious environment.

# Setup

To build this library in a static way, include all files (as well as `.cpp` files) and add `#define QPLDLL_EXPORTS` to the pre-processor defines. This will remove the "inconsistent dll linkage" errors. It is build by default with SFML enabled, so you have to include and link the [SFML](https://www.sfml-dev.org/) library in order to compile your program. SFML can be turned off by defining `QPL_NO_SFML` as a preprocessor define.

There are 3 defines, that, if written **before** `#include <qpl/qpl.hpp>` or defined as a preprocessor define will have a different effect. 
`QPL_USE_ALL` to use all 3 below.

- `#define QPL_USE_INTRINSICS` enables (Intel) intrinsics and let's you use the optimized `qpl::x64_integer` types.
- `#define QPL_USE_VULKAN` this will enable the Vulkan utilites. You have to include and link the [Vulkan](https://www.khronos.org/vulkan/) library, [glm](https://glm.g-truc.net/0.9.9/index.html), [GLFW](https://www.glfw.org/) and [stb_image](https://github.com/nothings/stb) in order to compile your program. (`glfw3.lib` `vulkan-1.lib` linker dependencies)
- SFML is enabled by default. use `#define QPL_NO_SFML` to disable SFML utilies. Read at the start of this readme how to include and link SFML.
- `#define QPL_USE_GLEW` enables glew utilities to use 3D utilities with SFML. you need to include and link the glew [library](http://glew.sourceforge.net/). 

then there is also `#define QPL_BIG_LUT` (which is outside of `QPL_USE_ALL`) which loads up 66 tables with 1024 entries for high precision floating point arithmetic (32768 bits of mantissa accuracy). Without `QPL_BIG_LUT` the 66 tables are loaded with 32 entries and therefore have 1024 accurate bits of mantissa. these look up tables contain constant numbers such as pi, e, ln2, sqrt2, and e^x xâˆˆ(-31, 31) (excluding e^0)


these are the required linker dependencies:


- release x86/x64:
```
sfml-graphics.lib
sfml-window.lib
sfml-main.lib
sfml-system.lib
sfml-audio.lib
sfml-network.lib
```
- debug x86/x64:
```
sfml-graphics-d.lib
sfml-window-d.lib
sfml-main-d.lib
sfml-system-d.lib
sfml-audio-d.lib
sfml-network-d.lib
```

There are also the compiled GLEW binaries to use 3D utilities with SFML (`qpl-gl.lib`/`qpl-gl.dll` and `qpl-gl-d.lib`/`qpl-gl-d.dll`). You need to `#define QPL_USE_GLEW` for preprocessor and include & link the glew [library](http://glew.sourceforge.net/). Linker dependencies will look as follows:

- release x86/x64:
```
sfml-graphics.lib
sfml-window.lib
sfml-main.lib
sfml-system.lib
sfml-audio.lib
sfml-network.lib
opengl32.lib
glew32.lib
```
- debug x86/x64:
```
sfml-graphics-d.lib
sfml-window-d.lib
sfml-main-d.lib
sfml-system-d.lib
sfml-audio-d.lib
sfml-network-d.lib
opengl32.lib
glew32.lib
```

I need to create a useful features list here, but I don't have the time to explain all features from 70 thousand lines here ... I really wish to to this in the future and write a useful documentation. Please forgive me.
